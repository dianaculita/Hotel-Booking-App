# Hotel-Booking-App

The project combines Java and SQL database knowledge. 
The application contains a graphical user interface implemented in Java, within NetBeans, based on which the manager is able to fill a reservation form for one or more rooms and persons. 
The data extracted from the form is sent to a private database and further queries for data extraction and manipulation are possible. 
The result of any operation is available on the user interface.
